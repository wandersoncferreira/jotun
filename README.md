A Clojure library designed to interact with **Anti-Captcha** services
online. The idea is to have an unique interface to deal with providers
of anti-captcha utilities.


The first to be implemented will be the
[Anti-Captcha](https://anti-captcha.com/mainpage) from Coliseo. I've
being using this service for some time and I was missing a library to
provide interface for them and other facilities.

*jotun* are Nordic mythological creates with great-strength that are
often against the gods. The role and characteristics of the *giants*
are often unclear and contradictory, from brutal beasts with childish
intellect to wise ancient creatures. Peak your side.

<br clear=all /><br>

**Tasks implemented/available:**

 - [x] ImageToText: solve usual image captcha
 - [ ] NoCaptcha: Google Recaptcha puzzle solving
 - [ ] FunCaptcha: rotating captcha funcaptcha.com
 - [ ] SquareNetText: select objects on image with an overlay grid
 - [ ] GeeTest: sliding captcha from geetest.com
 - [ ] CustomCaptcha: image captcha with custom form.

There are still many decisions related to public interfaces and
project structure to be developed.

## Critical

The Anti-Captcha service is **paid**, therefore you need to get an
account at their WebSite and charge it with a few dolars. It's the
cheapest solution I found in the market.

Please insert your **client key** inside the
`config/{dev,prod}/config.edn` file.
