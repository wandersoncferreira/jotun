A Clojure library designed to interact with **Anti-Captcha** services
online. The idea is to have an unique interface to deal with providers
of anti-captcha utilities.


The first to be implemented will be the
[Anti-Captcha](https://anti-captcha.com/mainpage) from Coliseo. I've
being using this service for some time and I was missing a library to
provide interface for them and other facilities.

<br>
**Tasks implemented/available:**

 - [x] ImageToText: solve usual image captcha
 - [ ] NoCaptcha: Google Recaptcha puzzle solving
 - [ ] FunCaptcha: rotating captcha funcaptcha.com
 - [ ] SquareNetText: select objects on image with an overlay grid
 - [ ] GeeTest: sliding captcha from geetest.com
 - [ ] CustomCaptcha: image captcha with custom form.

There are still many decisions related to public interfaces and
project structure to be developed.
