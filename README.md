A Clojure library designed to interact with **Anti-Captcha** services
online. The idea is to have an unique interface to deal with provides
of anti-captcha facilities.

The first to be implemented will be the
[Anti-Captcha](https://anti-captcha.com/mainpage) from Coliseo. I've
being using this service for some time and I was missing a library to
provide interface for them and other facilities.
